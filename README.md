# CropValueForecast-MLP

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at forecasting the export value of crop products using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. The model uses historical agricultural data to predict crop export values three years into the future.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to forecast the export value of crop products using a variety of food and agricultural indicators sourced from the FAOSTAT database. The model is built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras, and leverages a feedforward neural network for regression.

## Project Structure

This project contains the following files and directories:

- `Final_Code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the MLP model code and analysis.
- `Data/`: Folder containing the 13 CSV files from FAOSTAT, used for training and testing the model.
- `model_predictions.xlsx`: The modelâ€™s predictions on the test set, stored in an Excel file.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is made up of data extracted from the [FAOSTAT database](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home), which provides open access to food and agricultural data for over 245 countries and covers years from the mid-1990s to the present day. It includes the following categories:
1. [Consumer prices indicators](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/CP)
2. [Crops production indicators](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL)
3. [Emissions](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GCE) & [Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GV)
4. [Employment](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/OEA)
5. [Exchange rate](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/PE)
6. [Fertilizers use](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RFB)
7. [Food balances indicators](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS)
8. [Food security indicators](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS)
9. [Food trade indicators](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TCL)
10. [Foreign direct investment](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FDI)
11. [Land temperature change](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET)
12. [Land use](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL)
13. [Pesticides use](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RP)

The data covers over 245 countries and spans from the mid-1990s to the present day. It includes variables relevant to food and agriculture, such as crop yields, prices, emissions, and more.

## Data Processing

The preprocessing steps in this project include:

- **Scaling**: The features were scaled using `MinMaxScaler` to ensure all variables were on the same scale.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variance.
- **Transformations**: The `PowerTransformer` was applied to normalize data distributions and reduce skewness.

## Model

The model used for this project is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) implemented using TensorFlow/Keras. Key details of the model are as follows:

- **Architecture**: The model consists of an input layer, two hidden layers, and a single output layer.
- **Layers**:
  - Input Layer: Takes the preprocessed features.
  - Hidden Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation functions and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
  - Output Layer: A single unit that predicts the export value (regression task).
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
- **Regularization**: Dropout layers and L2 regularization were applied to prevent overfitting.
  
## Performance

The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test set. The model was trained and validated on an 80/20 split of the data.
